## 1. Overview & Objectives

* The goal of AIS‑01: to define a set of principles, formats and Minimum API for Adaptive Intelligence systems to be:

* interoperable;
* verifiable adaptive behavior;
* open and integrated into the OSS ecosystem.

* Expected results: spec v0.1 (living document) + reference implementation + compliance tests.

## 2. Scope of application

* System type: agent, runtime, middleware, introspective compilers, adaptive OS modules.
* Level of application: core primitives (adaptive loop, state model, policy engine), plugin contract, observability contract.
* What is NOT in scope: detailed description of the internal ML/LLM model (only interface/hook description).

## 3. Terms & Definitions

* Adaptive Agent, Adaptive Loop, Introspection, Trust Memory, Rollback Policy, Sandbox Context, Behavior Engine, Plugin Contract, Compliance Suite, etc.
* Quantitative descriptions for vague terms (e.g., "level of adaptivity" 0..3).

## 4. Foundational Principles

* Open & Transparent
* Composability (module‑first)
* Reproducibility & Core Determinism
* Least Privilege & Sandboxing
* Human‑in‑the‑loop by Default
* Traceability & Auditability

## 5. Overall Architecture

* Layer Diagram: Application → Behavior Engine → Adaptive Core (Loop Controller, State Model, Experience Store) → Runtime/Plugin Host → Sandbox/OS
* Main Components:

* Adaptive Core (controller, scheduler)
* State Model & Trust Memory
* Policy Engine / Behavior Rules
* Plugin Host / Loader (Lua/C++ bridge)
* Observability & Telemetry
* Compliance Monitor & Rollback Manager

## 6. Adaptive Loop Description

* Phases: Sense → Interpret → Decide → Act → Learn → (optionally) Rollback
* Data exchange between phases (template schema)
* Time and constraints (hard/soft deadlines)
* Hooks for introspection and human override

## 7. Module & plugin standards

* File layout & naming convention
* Module metadata (manifest): id, version, capabilities, dependencies, permissions
* Lifecycle methods: init, probe, run, quiesce, shutdown
* Semantic versioning & compatibility rules

## 8. Interface (API) and data format

* Spec REST/gRPC/local IPC contracts for:

* State read/write
* Event publish/subscribe
* Policy evaluation query
* Telemetry ingestion
* JSON schemas / protobuf examples for core messages

## 9. DSL / Lua bridge specification

* Goal: how plugin authors write rules/behaviors in Lua and securely link to core C++
* API exposed to Lua (sandboxed): read_state(key), propose_action(action), request_rollback(reason)
* Security model: capability tokens, call timeouts, memory quotas
* Serialization rules between Lua and host

## 10. Sandbox, Safety & Self‑defense rules

* Sandbox primitives: resource limits, syscall filtering, network egress policy
* Safety policies: forbidden actions, escalation rules, kill switches
* Self‑defense model: anomaly detector → containment → notification → forensic log
* Human emergency override & policy approval workflow

## 11. Logging, Observability & Rollback

* Standard log format (structured logs), correlation IDs, causal traces
* Telemetry metrics (latency, adaptivity score, policy violations)
* Rollback policy definition: scopes, retention, automated vs manual
* Forensics and reproducibility: snapshotting, deterministic replay

## 12. Bao Confidentiality, Privacy and Responsibility

* Data classification & handling rules
* Access control model (RBAC / capability‑based)
* Compliance with privacy principles (anonymization, minimal retention)
* Responsible disclosure & vulnerability handling

## 13. Test suite & Compliance criteria

* Test categories: unit (determinism), integration (adaptive loop behavior), security (sandbox escape), performance (throughput), reproducibility (replay tests)
* Compliance levels: AIS‑C0 (baseline), AIS‑C1 (recommended), AIS‑C2 (strict)
* Reference test runner, how to publish results (badging)

## 14. Governance, Contribution & Licensing

* Suggested licenses for core/spec (Apache‑2.0 + contributor license optional agreements)
* Governance model options: benevolent dictator, meritocratic council, foundation model
* Contribution flow: issue → RFC → implementation → compliance test → approval

## 15. Reference Implementation

* Minimal core repo structure
* Example modules: state_store, behavior_rule_engine, lua_plugin_host, rollback_manager
* Quickstart guide: build → run → run sample scenario

## 16. Use cases

* Intrusion detection + adaptive rollback
* Personalization proxy for vehicle driver (AIForDriver example)
* Cooperative multi‑agent adaptation (research scenario)
* Controlled model fine‑tuning via policy engine

## 17. Application & Versioning Roadmap

* AIS‑01 milestones: spec v0.1 draft → ref impl v0.1 → compliance suite v0.1 → community review
* Versioning rules: semantic + capability tags

## 18. References & Appendices

* Template manifest, JSON schema, protobufs
* Template CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, GOVERNANCE.md
* Glossary and academic references
